# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### Do NOT

- Open a public GitHub issue
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### DO

1. Email security details to: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
2. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution**: Security patches will be released as soon as possible

## Security Best Practices

### Running in Production

1. **Use Official Images**: Always use official Docker images from trusted registries
2. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update to the latest patch version
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets or API keys to version control
4. **Network Security**: Use network policies and firewalls to restrict access
5. **TLS/HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
6. **Rate Limiting**: Configure appropriate rate limits
7. **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and alerting
8. **Backup**: Regularly backup configuration and data

### Container Security

Our Docker images follow these security practices:

- ✅ Non-root user (UID 1001)
- ✅ Minimal base image (Alpine Linux)
- ✅ No unnecessary packages
- ✅ Read-only root filesystem (where possible)
- ✅ Dropped Linux capabilities
- ✅ Security scanning with Trivy
- ✅ Regular base image updates
- ✅ Signed commits and images

### Kubernetes Security

When deploying to Kubernetes:

1. **Pod Security Standards**: Use restricted pod security standards
2. **Network Policies**: Implement network segmentation
3. **RBAC**: Use minimal Role-Based Access Control
4. **Secrets Management**: Use Kubernetes secrets or external secret managers
5. **Image Pull Policy**: Set to `Always` or use specific tags
6. **Resource Limits**: Always set CPU and memory limits
7. **Security Context**: Run containers with security context
8. **Pod Disruption Budgets**: Ensure high availability

### Dependency Security

We use multiple tools to ensure dependency security:

- **npm audit**: Automatic vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated vulnerability alerts

### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks
- **CORS**: Properly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy headers enabled
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers middleware
- **Error Handling**: Errors don't expose sensitive information

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

1. **Helmet.js**: Adds security headers
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-XSS-Protection
   - Strict-Transport-Security
   - Content-Security-Policy

2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse
   - Configurable per endpoint
   - IP-based throttling
   - Distributed rate limiting support

3. **Input Validation**: Sanitizes all inputs
   - URL validation
   - Parameter validation
   - Body parsing limits

4. **CORS**: Controlled cross-origin access
   - Configurable origins
   - Credentials handling
   - Preflight caching

### Monitoring and Logging

- Structured logging with log levels
- Security event logging
- Error tracking and alerting
- Audit logs for sensitive operations

## Known Security Considerations

### Puppeteer/Chromium

- Runs in sandboxed mode
- Limited system access
- Configurable timeout and resource limits
- No persistent storage

### External Requests

- Timeout protection
- Resource size limits
- URL validation
- Rate limiting per domain

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] Update all secrets in `k8s/secret.yaml`
- [ ] Configure TLS certificates
- [ ] Enable network policies
- [ ] Set resource limits
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Enable security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Review and update CORS configuration
- [ ] Set up backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Test security controls
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
